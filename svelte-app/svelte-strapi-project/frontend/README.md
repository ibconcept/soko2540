# Svelte and Strapi Project

This project is a full-stack application that utilizes Svelte for the frontend and Strapi for the backend. Below are the details for setting up and running both parts of the application.

## Frontend (Svelte)

The frontend is built using Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see the application in action.

### Project Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file where the Svelte app is mounted.
- `src/App.svelte`: The main Svelte component that serves as the entry point for the application.
- `src/main.js`: The JavaScript entry point that imports the App component and mounts it to the DOM.
- `src/components/ExampleComponent.svelte`: An example Svelte component that can be used within the App component or other components.

## Backend (Strapi)

The backend is built using Strapi, a headless CMS that provides a powerful API for managing content.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Strapi server:
   ```
   npm run develop
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1337/admin` to access the Strapi admin panel.

### Project Structure

- `api/example/controllers/example.js`: Handles requests related to the example resource.
- `api/example/models/example.js`: Defines the data model for the example resource.
- `api/example/services/example.js`: Contains business logic related to the example resource.
- `config/database.js`: Configuration settings for connecting to the database.
- `config/server.js`: Configuration settings for the Strapi server.

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for building a full-stack application using Svelte and Strapi. You can extend the functionality by adding more components to the frontend and resources to the backend as needed.
