# Svelte and Strapi Project Backend

This is the backend part of the Svelte and Strapi project. The backend is built using Strapi, a headless CMS that allows you to create and manage your content easily.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd svelte-strapi-project/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the database**:
   Update the `config/database.js` file with your database connection settings.

4. **Run the Strapi server**:
   ```
   npm run develop
   ```

   This will start the Strapi server in development mode.

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes various API endpoints for managing the example resource. You can find the logic for these endpoints in the `api/example/controllers/example.js` file.

## Folder Structure

- `api/`: Contains the API logic for different resources.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the database and server.
- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies and scripts for the backend.
